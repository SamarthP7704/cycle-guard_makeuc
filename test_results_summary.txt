====================================

✅ SYSTEM STATUS: Working
✅ Video Processing: Successfully processing all videos
✅ Person Detection: Working correctly
✅ Embedding Extraction: Working (using fallback method)

TEST RESULTS:
-------------
1. Drop-off Video:
   - Status: ✅ Processed successfully
   - Person detected: Yes
   - Cycle detected: No
   - Embedding extracted: 616 dimensions

2. Pickup Video (Same Person):
   - Status: ✅ Processed successfully
   - Person detected: Yes
   - Cycle detected: No
   - Similarity with drop-off: 0.979 (97.9%)
   - Result: ✅ CORRECT - Same person identified

3. Steal Video (Different Person):
   - Status: ✅ Processed successfully
   - Person detected: Yes
   - Cycle detected: Yes
   - Similarity with drop-off: 0.969 (96.9%)
   - Result: ⚠️  FALSE POSITIVE - Incorrectly identified as same person

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
The fallback feature extraction method is not discriminative enough.
Similarity scores are too high (0.969) for different people.

SOLUTIONS:
----------
1. Install torchreid for better accuracy:
   pip install torchreid
   
2. Adjust similarity threshold (lower it):
   Edit .env: SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.85
   
3. Improve feature extraction method
   
4. Use Reka AI for ambiguous cases (when available)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Install torchreid: pip install torchreid
2. Re-run tests to see improved accuracy
3. Adjust threshold if needed
4. Consider using Reka AI for production
